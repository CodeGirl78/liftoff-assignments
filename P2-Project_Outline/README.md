For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a music collection library that will allow users to create an account, login and out of their account once created and create their very own music library.  They will be able to update their library by adding and/or deleting albums which will include artist’s first and last name, album title, and genre of music.  They will also be able to utilize search functionality by searching for a particular artist or group, album title, or by genre.

This project was motivated by my need for organization of my own music library in which I’m an avid collector of CDs, cassette tapes, and record albums.  It is my hope that other avid music collectors will be able to find this useful for their collections as well. 

### Features
*	**User sign-up**: Users will be able to create a new account for themselves, allowing them to create their very own music collection by inputting their own music albums.

### What I'll Have to Learn
In the course of building my project, I will need to learn either how to make a .csv file or if possible, how to save an excel sheet as a .csv file in order to import and add data via MySQL query.  I will also need to learn how to add search functionality.  I’m sure there are many other things that I will have to learn during the course of making this app and therefore, as I come across them, I will add them here.
